  <h2>Why I'm a Fan</h2>

    <p style="font-family:Roboto">Wong Kar Wai is a film director from Hong Kong noted for his atmospheric films about memory, longing, and the passage of time. The first time I ever saw a film of his, I was 23 in NY city. I had just come back from Italy after living life as an ex-pat studying photography. The romanticism of his surroundings and relationships was instantly a familiar landscape for the nomadic life I was already living and having lived far from loved ones most of my life it’s hard not to be nostalgic by nature. I was also fresh out of college and deeply devoted to the art of image and Wong Kar Wai did not fail me with his rich colors and dramatic camera shots. Till this day, as a devote film buff, no one has surpassed the love I have for his films, they’ve influenced me for the last decade and I can honestly say that he is my biggest influence.</p>
